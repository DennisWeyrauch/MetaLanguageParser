//-- Â§checkOption($$OPTIONNAME$$trueHandler$$falseHandler$$)
	Command readin in DefFiles
	If Option exists, then execute "trueHandler" (overlapps with Filename)
	else either an alternative FalseHandler or the rest of the file

Will call a file named "trueHandler" (ofc different names) that contains:
// Should look previously if said function is already compiled in a satelite assembly

/* namespace ? {} */
public partial class OptionHandler { // Always this Type-Signature
	// General signature of methods (which are named after the file)
	public Delegate Dictionary<string,string> optHandler(ref Listwalker list, ref int pos);
	// Rule of Concern: Arrive on first, leave on last 
	 (consider if I even need the ExeBuilder anywhere)
	Read in the tokens as wanted and save them as { key, value} into the dict.
		They will be printed into equal named FillIns of the DestFiles then

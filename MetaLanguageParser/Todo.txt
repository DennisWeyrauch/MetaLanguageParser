### Todo
Supply Codefile via arg as well
(!!) Add proper method/class structure (at least Main/Programm) to allow executing the code
(!!!) Typing model
(!) Gradually build Memberstructure (see #dev02#)
Put the Tokenizer after the reading of Operators, and somehow include them in the splitting
Don't forget to collect the files via ResxExtension now.
In the check of if main Config exists, also check (throw on flag) if operator, §progam and §main exist

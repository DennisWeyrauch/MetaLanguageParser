### Todo
Supply Codefile via arg as well
(!!) Add proper method/class structure (at least Main/Programm) to allow executing the code
(!!!) Typing model
(!) Gradually build Memberstructure (see #dev02#)
Put the Tokenizer after the reading of Operators, and somehow include them in the splitting
Don't forget to collect the files via ResxExtension now.

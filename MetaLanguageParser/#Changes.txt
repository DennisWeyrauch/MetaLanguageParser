Transformed fuzzy parts of Compiler into base code

## 2016-05-26
Finished base code
# 2
Made a full run fixing all errors
## 2016-06-04
Added full code to add arbitary keywords as metaDef-File, using them in .mcode, and printing them in correct and okey'ish looking C#-Code.
## 2016-06-05
Non-IDE changes like adding #warnings at some places and stuff
## 2016-06-13
After some shitty hours with the ResourceManagementSystem of .NET I retreated to Serializable Dictionaries. Well, that works now. And you can specify the language via command line
## 2016-06-14
Cleaned up Builder Code
ResourceSaving/Loading works now the way I want.
Can specify language with ProgArgument
## 2016-06-18
Fully working Operator Reader/Writer
#Appendix (00:30 AM)
... Almost. MultiChar Operators have to be added to the tokenizer before they work.
## 2016-06-21
Uploaded to GitHub!
## 2016-06-22
Some small changes to ExeBuilder's future use (also threw out Scoping Stuff)
Also renamed all langCode files to respective filesuffix
And seperated Changes/Todo
#Later....
Moved around stuff, deleted unneeded ones, added readme to ResxDir
Also made VB.net work (excluding options)
#Later again...
Now the "NonStackingIf" works as well: Instead of an option, it is implemented via an ˜retract command used at the start of Dest Files
## 2016-06-24
Added some method stuff, like AddMethod, MethodData, LocalData
## 2016-06-29
AddMethod, VarDecl, adn Assign work now.
At least, for the main method; Int32; and Locals; resp.
#Later.... (23:00+....)
Made §varDecl dynamic so that it reads the format strings out of "_vardecl.txt"
Fixed that indent problem, and it works without problems with Java and VB.Net as well.
## 2016-07-02
Added §addType and §readLine
More or less finished the whole construction so that it would work
Parsing in of Datatypes and modifiers is still missing
## 2016-07-03
Added an config-File to modify paths and the DebugSwitch "Print Parts"
##2016-07-14
I think I forgot one or two days....
Anyway, enabled Readin of Types (build In only; others are not invalid, but marked with _MISSING_X)
Also added Custom Literals Decoration (for Char and String, more to come)
And added §comment to allow Writing Comments

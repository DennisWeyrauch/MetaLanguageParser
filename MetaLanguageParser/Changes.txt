### Todo
Supply Codefile via arg as well
(!!) Add proper method/class structure (at least Main/Programm) to allow executing the code
(!!!) Typing model
Add a proper File explaining all commands 
(#) CodeCommands
 -- §addType
 -- §addMember
(#) DefParseCommands
 -- §checkOption --> see devFile
(#) DestParseCommands
 -- §forEach // For SwitchCases
 -- §addImport
 -- §addMethod(){
	// Checks if a method with this signature already exists or generates if not, and inserts a MethodCall at the current pos.
	Example: toCharArray() has to be defined in Javascript
}

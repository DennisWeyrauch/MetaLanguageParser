After some shitty hours with the ResourceManagementSystem of .NET I retreated to Serializable Dictionaries. Well, that works now. And you can specify the language via command line

Cleaned up Builder Code
ResourceSaving/Loading works now the way I want.
Can specify language with ProgArgument

Fully working Operator Reader/Writer
#Appendix (00:30 AM)
... Almost. TwoChar Operators have to be added to the tokenizer before they work.

### Todo
//Fixing the lone newLine in Indent
//readParameterList just skips the parameters
//Rewrite SerializeableDictionary<string,string> to display as <entry name="myKey">myValue</entry>
--> Codefile via arg as well
(!) Add more operators (you can't do everything with '>' after all :P)
(!!) Add proper method/class structure (at least Main/Programm) to allow executing the code
//(!!!) making CustomInformation work, so that different types of ProgLang will work
--> ResourceManager
(!!!) Typing model
